XWiki Invitation Application
-------------------------------------------

Works on XWiki 2.4M2
XWiki Syntax: 2.0

This application creates a document called InvitationMessages and one called InvitationConfig the first time it runs. 
You may configure InvitationMessages to be a different file by navigating to the invitation section of the administration
interface and setting the field "Document containing email XObjects".

It is space agnostic and will create the documents in the same space as itself although it will be installed in the 
Invitation space by default.

Allows users to invite friends to join the wiki. Allows administrators to invite multiple people at once.
Administrators can define a template which augments the users' email message and subject line.
All messages are stored locally as well as sent.
If recipients of email feel that it is spam then they can click a unique link which will set a spam
flag on the email and the user who sent it will be unable to send more email until an administrator
marks the email as having been investigated.
