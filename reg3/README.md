Bug description
--------
Regression in xwiki-platform, can be demonstrated with a unit test.

Issue: http://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13916
BaseClass#addTextAreaField try to modify existing field without checking if it's already the right type.
Before that addTextAreaField was not doing anything if the field already existed.

Regression caused by commit: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/dc2ae27469957d9d93d01005f9f9a66450892c6c

Regression fixed by commit: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/2d6845283dc9a7d1f0964127fe8116795f1b0581

Note that a test was added to prove that the fix worked and so that we donâ€™t cause more regression in the future.
